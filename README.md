# Email Spam Classification

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning classifier to detect spam emails. Using a dataset of email features, we build and evaluate a model that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages with high accuracy.

```

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 4,601 email messages with 57 features, including:
- Word frequency features (e.g., frequency of words like 'make', 'address', 'all')
- Character frequency features (e.g., frequency of characters like ';', '(', '!', '$')
- Capital run features (average, longest, and total length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters)
- A binary target variable (1 for spam, 0 for non-spam)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms
  - Logistic Regression - For binary classification
  - train_test_split - For splitting data into training and testing sets
  - accuracy_score - For model evaluation

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the dataset from a remote source
   - Examine the structure and statistics of the data

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (75% training, 25% testing)

3. **Model Training**
   - Initialize a Logistic Regression classifier
   - Train the model on the training data

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Make predictions on the test set
   - Calculate and display the model's accuracy
   - Analyze the model's performance metrics

## Results
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of [X]% on the test set
- The model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas jupyter scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook spam_detector.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to execute the analysis

## Future Work
- Experiment with other classification algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Perform feature selection to identify the most important features
- Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time spam detection
